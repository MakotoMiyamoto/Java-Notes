# Java-Notes
This is a compilation of all my notes taken whilst learning Java. No knowledge within my repository comes from the class I took in Junior year of high school. That class was lower than introductory, and to call the curriculum futile is giving it the benefit of the doubt. That being said, I hope you -- the aspiring programmer -- can and will learn from the notes in this repository. Good luck learning!
